# dynamic-time-wraping-similarity
dynamic time wraping similarity (DTW) explained in problem

there is cafe shops in every cities of italy, that serve different type of coffees. the researcher find out that disscount offer for sperso in milan city is so effective in field of selling. they want to offer similar discount for other cities, that customer act similar to milan.
